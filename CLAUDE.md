# CLAUDE.md


## Definition of Done

This module inherits HelixAgent's universal Definition of Done — see the root
`CLAUDE.md` and `docs/development/definition-of-done.md`. In one line: **no
task is done without pasted output from a real run of the real system in the
same session as the change.** Coverage and green suites are not evidence.

### Acceptance demo for this module

<!-- TODO: replace this block with the exact command(s) that exercise this
     module end-to-end against real dependencies, and the expected output.
     The commands must run the real artifact (built binary, deployed
     container, real service) — no in-process fakes, no mocks, no
     `httptest.NewServer`, no Robolectric, no JSDOM as proof of done. -->

```bash
# TODO

## MANDATORY: No CI/CD Pipelines

**NO GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or any automated pipeline may exist in this repository!**

- No `.github/workflows/` directory
- No `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
- No Jenkinsfile, .travis.yml, .circleci, or any other CI configuration
- All builds and tests are run manually or via Makefile targets
- This rule is permanent and non-negotiable

## Project Overview

DocProcessor is a Go module for loading project documentation, building structured feature maps, and tracking verification coverage. Part of the HelixQA ecosystem.

**Go module:** `digital.vasic.docprocessor`

## Build Commands

```bash
go build ./...                        # Build
go test ./... -race -count=1          # Test with race detection
go vet ./...                          # Static analysis
make all                              # tidy + vet + test + build
make test-cover                       # Test with coverage report
```

## MANDATORY Rules

- **NO test may ever be removed, disabled, skipped, or left broken**
- All tests must pass with `go test ./... -race -count=1`
- All source files must have SPDX license headers (Apache-2.0)
- CoverageTracker MUST remain thread-safe (sync.RWMutex)
- DocGraph MUST remain thread-safe (sync.RWMutex)
- LLMAgent interface MUST NOT have module-level dependencies

## Package Layout

```
pkg/loader/    - Loader interface, Document, Section, markdown/yaml parsers, scanner
pkg/feature/   - Feature, FeatureMap, FeatureMapBuilder, categories, screens
pkg/coverage/  - CoverageTracker (thread-safe), CoverageReport, Evidence, Issue
pkg/docgraph/  - DocGraph, Node, Edge, JSON/Mermaid export
pkg/llm/       - LLMAgent interface, RawFeature, prompt templates
pkg/config/    - Config from .env files
cmd/docprocessor/ - CLI entry point
```

## Test Types

- Unit tests (`*_test.go`)
- Integration tests (`*_integration_test.go`)
- Stress tests (`*_stress_test.go`) -- concurrent operations
- Security tests (`*_security_test.go`) -- path traversal, large files, malformed input
- E2E tests (`e2e_test.go`) -- full pipeline with mock LLMAgent
- Automation tests (`automation_test.go`) -- build validation, package structure

## Key Patterns

- `CoverageTracker`: Read operations use `RLock()`, write operations use `Lock()`
- `DocGraph`: Thread-safe with `sync.RWMutex`
- Feature IDs: Deterministic via `GenerateID(name)` -- slug + hash suffix for long names
- MaxFileSize: 10 MB limit on loaded files
- LLMAgent: Injected interface, no module-level dependency on LLMOrchestrator

## Dependencies

- `github.com/stretchr/testify` (testing)
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` (YAML parsing)

## Integration Seams

| Direction | Sibling modules |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Upstream (this module imports) | none |
| Downstream (these import this module) | HelixQA |

*Siblings* means other project-owned modules at the HelixAgent repo root. The root HelixAgent app and external systems are not listed here — the list above is intentionally scoped to module-to-module seams, because drift *between* sibling modules is where the "tests pass, product broken" class of bug most often lives. See root `CLAUDE.md` for the rules that keep these seams contract-tested.
